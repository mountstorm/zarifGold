    question: 'How does the bespoke commission process work?',
    answer: 'Our commission process begins with an in-depth consultation to understand your vision, space, and cultural preferences. We collaborate on pattern selection, color palette, and dimensions. Once the design is finalized, our master artisans begin the hand-weaving process, which typically takes 6-18 months depending on size and complexity. You receive progress updates throughout, and each piece is certified upon completion.'
